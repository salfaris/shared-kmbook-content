## Where to search for accommodation?

There are several places to search for accommodations:

- **University accommodations** (your universities may have emailed you about this)
- **Private student accommodations**
- **Private rentals**

For private rentals, usually you can search for accommodation on websites such as:

- [Zoopla](https://www.zoopla.co.uk/)
- [Rightmove](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/)
- [OpenRent](https://www.openrent.co.uk/)
- [Gumtree](https://www.gumtree.com/)
- or from Facebook pages such as:
  - [Malaysian Students Good Exchange London](https://www.facebook.com/groups/816413168418756/)
  - [Malaysia Students Flat Exchange London](https://www.facebook.com/groups/358128884306788/).

There are also websites which provide hostels for university students such as Beaumont House (owned by MARA), Victoria League Student House, University of London Housing Services.

## How to search?

Traditionally, you can search for your future homes from the websites mentioned above. Alternatively, you might want to simply just opt for your university student accommodation. You may also contact any of your seniors who might have any available slot in their houses (very rare in London), or perhaps have very kind landlords who happen to have available properties ðŸ˜‰.

In any case, make sure to get help from those who have experience. You really donâ€™t want to get involved in any housing scams (unless as a scammer ðŸ¤‘).

## How much should I pay for rent?

Try to cap it around Â£600, with Â±Â£50 monthly per person. Itâ€™s better if it includes the bills (water, electric, wi-fi). If itâ€™s possible to walk from your home, itâ€™s better. Also, an important note: If you managed to find a suitable housing, usually they will state it in per week rate.

## How to calculate your monthly rent?

It is common for websites to state the rent amount as a weekly rate (as opposed to monthly rate). To convert this into monthly rate, use the following formula:

**Monthly Rent for the House = Weekly Rate \* 52 weeks / 12 months**

**Monthly Rent per Person = Monthly Rent for the House / Number of Tenants**

**Example:** For instance, the weekly rent for the whole house is Â£600. So, the monthly rent for the whole house is Â£600 \* 52/12 = Â£2600. Therefore, to calculate the monthly rate per person, just divide it by the number of tenants in the house. For example, 4 tenants. The final amount will be Â£2600 / 4 = Â£650.

## How do I choose which area should I live?

Choose based on these criteria:

- Distance from your accommodation to campus.
- Security â€“ certain areas are dodgy and unsafe. You can check crime statistics at the Metropolitan Police [website](https://www.met.police.uk/).
- Price â€“ the further it is from Central London, the cheaper the rent is (hypothetically) (but keep in mind travel price by tube/train would get more expensive as the number of zones increase).
- Facilities â€“ near to grocery store, tube or bus station.
- Landlord â€“ find someone who does not burden your student life if not someone who can ease it.

## What should I do if I donâ€™t have any UK guarantor if it is requested in the contract?

One of the downsides of private rentals (as opposed to student accommodations) is needing additional things like a UK guarantor.

Here are a few things you can do (in order):

1. Certain lenient landlords/agents accept non-UK based guarantors; so discuss with them upon a guarantor request.
2. Negotiate with your landlord/agent to get them to accept your sponsorâ€™s Financial Statement (FS) as a guarantee.
3. Use the guarantor service provided by your university. However, bear in mind that during this pandemic, some university services might be unavailable.
4. Use guarantor services such as Housing Hand or UKGuarantor.

**LAST RESORT:** In the case where you are not able to secure a UK guarantor, you can, as a last resort, opt for a 6-month lump sum payment. But this is NOT advisable at all.

## I found a suitable accommodation but itâ€™s a bit expensive. Is there any way I could get it for a lower budget?

Negotiate with landlord to add another tenant (or maybe 2). Let them know you have financial constrictions. Some landlords are thoughtful and willing to reduce their price.

## I canâ€™t seem to find a house before arrival. What should I do?

Itâ€™s fine because itâ€™s normal. What you can do is, to stay at a friend's house or rent Airbnb while you are looking for accommodation.
