## What are the banks available, and which bank should I choose?

Banks that are commonly used among Malaysians students include:

- Barclays
- Lloyds
- HSBC
- Santander

It is advisable to choose a bank with a branch near to your accommodation so that bank-related business can be dealt with much more easily. However, this is optional.

## How do I open a bank account in the UK?

In general, it can be thought of as a three-step process:

1. Go to the website of your preferred bank and apply for a bank account online.
2. Get a hard copy of your confirmation study letter from your respective university (this will be used as proof to confirm your address)
3. Attend the bank’s branch of your choice for verification.

**Note:** The procedure differs from bank to bank but they are fairly straightforward.

**Tip:** You can book a bank appointment before your flight so that you can open your bank account faster.

## How do I transfer money from Malaysia to the UK?

Some common methods include:

- Money transfer services (recommended): Common apps are **MoneyMatch** and **Wise** _(formerly known as Transferwise)_. These apps can be used to transfer your money between international bank accounts. It also handles currency exchanges, and these apps charge a reasonably low fee.
- Telegraphic Transfer (TT): A cheque provided by a Malaysian bank, to be given to a UK bank.
- Direct Withdrawal: Direct withdrawal from UK ATM machines that accept a Malaysia bank card.

**NOTE:** As a rule of thumb, use direct withdrawal only for a small amount of money. This is because there is a cap on how much money you can withdraw per transaction (per day), and for each transaction, you are charged with a transfer fee.

The method of transfer you choose affects how much total money you will receive in GBP. This is because there is always a transfer fee, and an exchange rate for MYR/GBP. The best method will always be the one that has the **lowest fee** and the **lowest exchange rate.**

## What is the method for daily transactions?

Cashless is the way to go. Your general method will be contactless cards even at small convenience stores. In fact, certain small shops don't accept contactless payments under £5. However, note that some shops still accept cash.

**NOTE:** In the current pandemic, some shops **only** accept card or contactless payment.

## I keep hearing about Monzo. What is it?

Monzo is an online bank based in the UK which we highly recommend. You can open your Monzo bank before arriving in London. Is Monzo the only online bank? No, of course. Other online banks include Starling, Revolut and Monease.

**Tips:** Always be on the lookout for referrals from seniors as you may get awesome perks such as cash vouchers (and sometimes even money!) when you sign up with the referrals given by your seniors. It also helps your seniors as well as they too will receive cool perks.

## Can I just create a Monzo bank account instead of Barclays, Lloyds and other main banks?

Unfortunately, no. Monzo does not provide an IBAN (International Bank Account Number). So, international transfers into Monzo cannot be done. This is usually an issue upon arrival as once you have settled down here, this is not really a problem.

## How much is the allowance provided by MARA? When will it be given?

The MARA allowance for London is £1045.

Usually, starting from your first February in London (which will be your seventh month here), they will transfer the money to your UK bank account between 21st to 27th January.

**NOTE:** It is important to note that MARA will give you a one-off payment amounting to 6 months worth of allowance (£1045 × 6) together with house deposit allowance (£1425 as of batch 2020), both in MYR, into your Malaysian bank account. This means you have to do the currency exchange by yourself.

## How should I divide my money?

It can start with something as simple as ‘Money Spent’ and ‘Money left’ to a more detailed plan like the one provided in this [spreadsheet](http://tiny.cc/londoncalculator). You can also find price ranges for groceries and concerts. Before opening it, please read the guide below first. Alternatively, you can use the features in Monzo to set & stick to your budget.
