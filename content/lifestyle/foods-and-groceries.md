**Tip:** A good idea is to get membership cards for groceries so that you can collect points and clubcard member prices (Tesco).

For an outside meal, it can be quite pricey but it really depends on the type of food that you are having and how fancy the place is. For example, you can get a Subway subs with the price starts at £5 whereas a burger set from Burger and Lobster costs you from £15. The more frequent you eat out, the more expensive it is, but there’s no harm in treating yourself occasionally.

## How accessible is the halal foods and groceries?

There are quite a number of halal restaurants. Here is a limited list of some of the common ones:

- **Malaysian**: Malaysian Hall, Tukdin, Melur, Rasa Sayang, Roti King
- **Chinese takeout**: Chopstix, Wok2Walk
- **Pizza**: ICCO, Pizza Go Go
- **Indian**: Khan’s, Dishoom
- **Korean**: Wing Wing, Wingstop

For halal groceries, it is not as much as the restaurants but they are still accessible, depending on where you live.

Note: In a Muslim-majority area, even Subway and KFC are halal. Plus, Tesco and Sainsbury’s in this area also provide halal poultry but not much.

## Is Malaysian or Asian food products available?

Yes, but not as accessible as Tesco and Sainsbury's. You can find them at oriental stores and Chinatown.
