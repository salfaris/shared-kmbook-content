## What are the transportations available for daily use?

Most common transportations include:

1. Underground tubes (think LRT)
2. Bus
3. Bicycle
4. Trains
5. Black cabs
6. E-hailing services (e.g. Uber, Ola)

<!-- London is cashless, meaning most services do not accept cash (but you can top-up your cards at tube stations). You can use your contactless debit cards (ie Monzo, Barclays cards) or Oyster cards (only for public transportations, available to be purchased at tube stations). There are Oyster cards specially for students which you can have discounted rates (read more here). -->

## How much do I need to pay?

- **Bus**: £1.50 for unlimited journeys, within one hour of touching in.
- **Tube**: £2.80 per one-way trip, in the same zone. If you travel beyond zone 1 & 2 the cost will increase.
- **Trains**: £2.40 but like tubes, costs can increase.
- **Bicycles**: For _Santander Cycles_, £2 to take it out from dock, 30 minutes free and then £2 for every subsequent 30 minutes.

**Cycling is only recommended to those who are very skilled**. Statistically, there are more bus-cyclist accidents than bus-pedestrians.

All of this sounds like a lot, but there is _daily capping_, _bus pass_ and _Travelcards_ (see key terms below) for daily users like us.

<Accordion title="Key terms">

- **Daily capping**: Once your expenses reach £7.20 (may vary) due to travelling (on the tubes and/or buses) within the same zone, all your next trips for whole day will not be charged.

- **Bus pass**: This is a monthly pass that allows you to travel on buses at a cheaper rate. It costs about £50.

- **Travelcard**: This is a pass that allows you to travel using the underground tubes and buses at a cheaper rate, given that it is within 2 zones (of your choosing during purchase). It offers a daily, weekly and monthly pass. It costs about £96.80 for a month.

## Should I buy the travelcard or just pay at a normal rate?

If you don’t need to use bus or tube on your daily basis, just stick to the normal rate (not buy Travelcard). The daily capping works well for you if there’s a day where you suddenly need to use a lot of transportations. For those who don’t need travelcard to travel to the university every weekday, the range of spending for transport usually is at £20-£40 monthly (but obviously depends on your activities), considering your needs to go out for groceries, shopping, visiting friends, etc.

## What is the average time taken for daily commute?

We suggest around 30 minutes in total, regardless any mode of transportation. Walking 30 minutes is perfectly normal.

## Is there any application for me to navigate in London?

Yes, you can use either **CityMapper** or **Google Maps**.

It is recommended to use CityMapper more as it provides more accurate and up-to-date info. The rule of thumb is to usually use CityMapper for transportations and Google Maps for precise walking directions.

## I’m confused, what is the difference between tube and trains?

In Londoner’s terms, tube refers to LRT-like transportation which covers only London, and are mostly deep underground. Trains are bigger (like MRT) and cover the UK (like ETS).

## I don’t understand how the ‘lines’ in Tube Map work.

Just like how LRT have Kelana Jaya Line, Ampang Line, Sri Petaling Line. It’s just the same, but different names. You can explore this [website](https://tfl.gov.uk/maps/track/tube) to learn more about tube maps. Get in touch with a senior if you need someone to explain it to you.
