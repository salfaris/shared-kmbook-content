## What documents should I bring?

1. UK Visas and Immigrations documents
2. TB certificate
3. Unconditional Offer Letter
4. Statement of student letter (from your university)
5. MARA offer letter
6. CAS letter (from your university)
7. Financial statement

## What items and food supplies should I bring?

For food supplies, packing some from Malaysia prevents you from spending too much in the beginning when setting up your kitchen.

If you’re a big Maggi Mi fan, don’t bother bringing a 3-month supply of Maggi noodles; you can find Maggi kari and ayam at some grocery stores here. Save your luggage space for something else. Most asian stores sell a wide variety of authentic asian brand instant noodles.

## I plan to buy electronic devices. Should I buy them in Malaysia or in the UK?

A big fat 'buy from Malaysia'. The UK charges 20% tax (VAT) which is higher than Malaysia. When buying electronic devices, try getting a device that offers a warranty that can be applied worldwide. It may help you if your device needs fixing in the future when you are in the UK.

## Should I pay for Visa Priority or Premium?

It is advisable to not pay for these services. In odd circumstances, such as you already have a flight date, you may consider paying extra for the priority Visa in hopes that your Visa can be issued quicker.

## For the TB test, do I need to get my X-Ray film?

**Please do so** because you will need it for a medical check-up, which is required by MARA. To understand this better, given that you are doing the TB test and medical check-up at different locations, for both check-up and TB test, you will undergo X-Ray scanning. However, it is not recommended to do a second X-Ray within 6 months after you had the first one. So, it is recommended to save the X-Ray film that you obtained through whichever you have done first, TB test or medical check-up.

## How much cash should I bring with me?

£500 is enough. You can bring more, but please be careful. Also, because of the pandemic, a lot of stores prefer contactless payment.

## Which airport should I choose for arrival?

Strongly suggest London Heathrow Airport (LHR). Stansted, Gatwick, Luton Airport are out of the list. This is because, upon arrival, it will be easier for you to navigate as the Piccadilly line (tube route) connects the airport to central London, while the other airports require a more complex process to get to Central London/your respective houses.

## How do I contact anyone or use internet services when I arrive?

LHR provides Wi-fi service. Or if you want a more stable connection, it is recommended to activate the sim-card UCAS sent you, though some of you might not have received it. The sim-card is probably a giffgaff or VOXI one. Activate it a day before departure so that by the time you arrive, your telco provider is already in service.
