## Do I have to wear a face mask? Is it required?

Usually, you are obliged to wear a face mask in enclosed spaces (malls, grocery stores, drugstores and public transportation), unless you are exempt from wearing a mask (you have a medical condition). It is your own responsibility to wear them in open spaces. However, it is encouraged that you wear a mask for your own safety as well as for others’.
