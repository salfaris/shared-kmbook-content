## What is the best telco provider available?

VOXI. It offers unlimited data for social media with a data package starting from £10 for 6GB. You can apply online, and they will send it straight to your door (Malaysia, but will be confirmed). Please explore other providers as well, such as Three, BT, and others. Users also are not stuck to any plan by any form of contract, so that means you can change your data plan anytime.

Just a heads up for any prepaid telco users, once you use up all your data for the month, there is no way you can reset to get all the data back for the month. You have no choice but to wait for the next month to come. But you can still purchase additional data. Alternatively, you may opt for telcos with unlimited mobile data and hotspots like Three, but that will cost more (£12 monthly for students).

If you do not have wifi set up yet, 6GB is most likely not enough for you especially if you use it for online class as well so be prepared to spend more on add-ons. But when you’ve settled down, the Voxi plan will be more than enough.

## How do I keep my Malaysian number active?

There are a few validity plans by different telco companies. Here are some options:

- **TuneTalk** - 365 days validity and 10GB basic internet, which cost RM100
- **Maxis** - 365 days validity and 500MB internet, which costs RM60
- **U Mobile** - you can email them to suspend your account. When you want to have it reactivated, email them again and you’ll only need to pay a RM10 fee for that. This can be done while you’re already in the UK, so you won’t have any problem using your number predeparture. You’ll only need to give them your IC copy and finish off any previous bills.

## What are the entertainments available?

There are parks everywhere. Bars and pubs are everywhere, if that suits your taste. Cinemas and theatres, shopping complex, sports complex, gyms, ice skating, bowling centres, funfairs and others. Doesn't differ much from Malaysia.

## How big should my luggage be?

Check the check-in luggage size and weight for your own ticket. Usually, it's 30-35kg for check-in luggage. Having a luggage weight scale beforehand will be useful for you to utilise your luggage weight limit.

## What does it mean by academic year and terms?

An academic year in the UK usually spans from September to May. ‘Term' is just another word for semester. Typically there are 3 terms:

-**Autumn Term** : from September to December (Winter Break) 
-**Spring Term** : from January to March (Easter Break) 
-**Summer Term** : April to May
Dates differ based on your degree course, you should be briefed precisely about the exact dates by your uni during your first week

## Can I drive in UK?

Your Malaysian license allows you to drive in the UK only for 12 months after residency. Afterwards, it's invalid.

## I am concern about changing of skincare products when flying to the UK. May I have some about that, like where can I buy the products?

Like Malaysia, we can buy the products online or offline. Firstly, Boots and Superdrug are the counterparts of Watsons and Guardians in the UK. You can visit the stores or order from their online websites or mobile app. Some brands available there include Cerave, Cetaphil, Olay, Neutrogena, Nivea, La Roche-Posay, Eucerin, Garnier, No7, Simple and many more.

Some popular websites are Beautybay (for brands such as The Ordinary, Cosrx, more), iHerb (Aveeno, K Beauty, more) and Deciem (The Ordinary, Hylamide, NIOD, more).
Also, you can find some asian brands like Hado Labo on Amazon. A’fah and Elinzee’s favourite website for Korean skincare is Stylevana.

## BRP vs passport

**BRP** is your IC, it is up to you if you wanna bring it with you. We never actually use it for anything except buying 18+ things (like alcohol and knives) and for something like parcel collection. Keep your **passport** at home.

## Electric / Gas/ Water bills

Unlike Malaysia, here you can choose your electricity/gas supplier. The rates from each company will differ depending on your location. You can view the comparison [here](https://www.moneysupermarket.com/) when you’re setting up your bills

When you’re ready, have a read of this thorough [bills 101 article](https://www.splitthebills.co.uk/advice-centre/student-bills-basics/setting-up-your-energy-bills/)

However, Thames Water is the only water supplier company for London. Here’s a page to learn more about the water bills but feel free to navigate to their [Help page](https://www.thameswater.co.uk/help/account-and-billing/understand-your-bill) as well for more info

In general, expect your bills (electric/gas, water and internet) to be around £50 per person per month.
